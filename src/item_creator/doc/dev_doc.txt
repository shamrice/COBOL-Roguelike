NOTE: Functionality is still in progress. Many features may not work at all yet!

Overview: 
    Item Creator is a utilty application where you can create and configure
    items that can be then accessed in the CRL Editor for placement
    on maps. This is so that items will remain consistant between maps as 
    well as decrease on map building time as each attribute of every item 
    does not need to be entered before the item is placed. 


How to use:
    * If "ITEM-LIST.LST" exists, the current list of items are loaded at 
      start up.
    * The user is prompted with either a blank list of items or a paged 
      list of existing items.
    * New items can be added using the 'N' key. When pressed, a new 
      item screen will be displayed with a suggested pre-filled item id.
      The default value is one higher than the highest id in the data
      set. This value can be edited, though switching to an existing id 
      will cause that record to be overwritten.
    * Existing items can be edited either by clicking on the row of 
      the record with the mouse or pressing 'E' and entering the 
      item id number. 
    * Both new item and edit item screens will have the following 
      fields:
        * Id - Either prefilled with new value or id of existing record.
        * Name - Name of the item (up to 16 characters).
        * Effect Id - Press F1 for the list of effects an item can have. 
          this Id must be one of these ids. 
            Ex: Effect-id 1 = increase gold
        * Worth/Value - This is an integer value (up to 999) that is 
          used to modify the player attribute or other field based on 
          the effect id. 
            Ex1: Effect id 1 & value of 5 will increase player's gold 
                 count by 5 gold. 
            Ex2: Effect id 5 (weapon) & value of 10 sets the players 
                 current attack damage to base value + 10
        * Color - The color id to use to draw the item. (0-7).
        * Char - The character to represent the item on the map. 
        * Highlight - True/False if the color should be the highlighted 
          color value or not when the character is drawn. 
        * Blink - True/False if the item should blink when drawn on
          the map. 
    * After the new/edit item screen is completed, the user will be 
      prompted if they would like to save these changes. If so, the 
      changes will be written to the "ITEM-LIST.LST" file. If not, 
      all entered values will be lost.
