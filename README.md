# COBOL Roguelike

This is a current work in progress. More of a sandbox of ideas of creating a tile based console game using GnuCOBOL. 

The title of "Rogue-ish" would probably fit better as the levels are created using the level editor instead of procedurely generated like in a true roguelike game.
